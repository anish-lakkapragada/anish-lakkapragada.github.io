This is my first blog post for this website, so needless to say (1) it is serving more as a
test than anything and (2) it is hard not to be nervous that I will forget about this blog and never update it again. My previous website/blog/GitHub-Pages-Hosted-Thing was _Moments of Clarity_ and has since moved to <https://old-anish.lakkapragada.com>. I am excited to turn the page and create a more focused website for my college years.

Specifically, I am hoping to use this space to post and host more carefully planned articles, notes, and pieces. Furthermore, I want this website to be more concentrated on my interests than my last one, which was terribly scattered. Those are my goals for myself, and I really hope I can satisfy them.

Regardless, thank you for visiting!
