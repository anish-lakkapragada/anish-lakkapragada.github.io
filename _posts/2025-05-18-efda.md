*TLDR: Generalizing the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) procedure to settings in which data in each class are all distributed according to the same exponential family distribution. Then testing this procedure with one such distribution, the Weibull.*

Hey all! Hope you are doing well as usual. I am hoping in this somewhat more involved blog post to 
- (1) give a brief overview of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and its relation to Logistic Regression 
- (2) generalize LDA to settings in which our data is distributed according to an exponential family distribution 
- (3) test our generalization in (2) with some toy datasets. 

We start with an introduction to LDA. 

### a primer on linear discriminant analysis  

*Note: While LDA and Logistic Regression can be extended to be used for multiple classes, we focus solely on binary classification in this post.*

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a classification technique which models the distribution of data conditional on its class (i.e. $$ X \mid Y$$), so as to create a (Bayes) classifier that models $$ Y \mid X $$. First note that this is in contrast to Logistic Regression, which directly models $$Y \mid X$$. Let us establish some preliminaries: supppose we have covariates $$ X = (x_1, \dots, x_p) \in \mathbb{R}^p$$ and binary response $$ Y \in \{0, 1\} $$. Our end goal is to model $$p(X) = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1 \mid X]$$, as it is well known that a classifier $$ h $$: 

$$
h(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } p(X) \geq 0.5 \\ 
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

is a Bayes Classifier[^bayes-classifier-note]. For logistic regression, $$p(X)$$ has the following form:

[^bayes-classifier-note]: Formally speaking, a Bayes Classifier is a classifier with the lowest possible missclassification rate (zero-one loss) compared to any other classifier on the same set of features. For a formal proof that $$h(x)$$ is a Bayes classifier, [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier). 

$$
p(X) = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1 \mid X] = \frac{\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^p \beta_i X_i)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^p \beta_i X_i)}
$$

for learnable parameters $$ \beta \in \mathbb{R}^{p + 1}$$. For LDA, however, this is done through Bayes Rule. Let us define $$f_0(x)$$ and $$f_1(x)$$ as the PDFs of $$ X \mid Y = 0$$ and $$ X \mid Y = 1 $$ respectively, and $$ \alpha = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1]$$, or the marginal probability of $$ Y = 1 $$ across all data. LDA then gives the following form for $$p(X)$$:

\begin{equation}
p(X) = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1 \mid X] = \frac{\mathbb{P}[X \mid Y = 1] \mathbb{P}(Y = 1)}{\mathbb{P}[X \mid Y = 1] \mathbb{P}(Y = 1) + \mathbb{P}[X \mid Y = 0] \mathbb{P}(Y = 0)} = \frac{\alpha f_1(x)}{\alpha f_1(x) + (1 - \alpha) f_0(x)}
\label{p-x}
\end{equation}

Thus, LDA's job is to learn $$f_0(x), f_1(x), $$ and $$\alpha$$ so as to model $$p(X)$$. To do so, it assumes that $$ X \in \mathbb{R}^p$$ has a normal distribution for each class with a shared covariance matrix $$ \mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$$. Restated, LDA posits: 

$$ 
X \mid Y = 1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu_{1}}, \mathbf{\Sigma}), \quad X \mid Y = 0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu_{0}}, \mathbf{\Sigma})
$$

Thus to model $$f_0(x)$$ and $$f_1(x)$$, LDA learns parameters $$\mathbf{\mu_{1}}, \mathbf{\mu_{0}}, \mathbf{\Sigma}$$ (and $$\alpha$$) through MLE on the given dataset $$\mathcal{D} = \{ (X_i, Y_i) \}_{i = 1}^{n}$$. The MLEs are given below:

$$
\hat{\alpha} = \frac{N_1}{n}, \quad \quad \underset{k \in \{0, 1\}}{\mathbf{\hat{\mu}_k}} = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i : Y_i = k} X_i, \quad \quad \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 0}^1 \sum_{i: Y_i = k} (X_i - \mathbf{\hat{\mu}_k})(X_i - \mathbf{\hat{\mu}_k})^T
$$

where $$N_1$$ and $$N_0$$ are the number of observations in $$\mathcal{D}$$ belonging to class one and zero respectively.

We conclude this section with providing some understanding of the commonalities and differences between logistic regression and LDA. We start by giving the log-odds ratio of the LDA: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\log \frac{\mathbb{P}[Y = 1 \mid X]}{\mathbb{P}[Y = 0 \mid X]} = \log \frac{\alpha f_1(x)}{(1 - \alpha) f_0(x)} = \log \frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} + \log \frac{\exp(-\frac{1}{2} (x - \mathbf{\mu_{1}})^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mathbf{\mu_{1}}) )}{\exp(-\frac{1}{2} (x - \mathbf{\mu_{0}})^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mathbf{\mu_{0}}) )} 
\label{log-odds}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
= \underbrace{\log \frac{\alpha}{1- \alpha} - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{\mu_{1}}^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{\mu_{1}} + \mathbf{\mu_{0}}^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{\mu_{0}}}_{\beta_0} + \sum_{i = 1}^p \underbrace{[\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{\mu_{1}} - \mathbf{\mu_{0}})]_i}_{\beta_i} \cdot X_i
$$

We can see that the log-odds ratios in LDA are modeled as a linear function of $$ x $$ (hence the name *Linear* Discriminant Analysis[^qda]). Furthermore, these coefficients in LDA can be thought of as parametrized versions of the logistic regression parameters $$ \beta $$. 

In a nutshell, LDA offers a clean closed-form solution in exchange for strong  parametric assumptions. Logistic regression gives us the opposite.

[^qda]: Note that if we were to suppose that each class has its class-dependent covariance matrix $$\Sigma_k$$, the log-odds ratio would be modeled as a quadratic function of $$ x $$. This technique is known as *Quadratic* Discriminant Analysis. 

### exponential family discriminant analysis 

The achilles heel of the LDA is that it requires the strong assumption that observations in each class follow a normal distribution with shared covariance. So what if we could perform the LDA procedure but for all sorts of distributions? In this blog post, we aim to do exactly that for distributions falling under an exponential family. 

##### exponential family: an abbreviated introduction

An *exponential family* is a set of probability distributions whose PDF $$ f(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta})$$ can be expressed as (using multivariable notation):  

$$ f(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta}) =  h(\mathbf{x}) \exp(\mathbf{\eta} \cdot T(\mathbf{x}) - A(\mathbf{\eta}))$$

Before we explain the meaning of these functions in this seemingly strange PDF, it is important to stress that many common distributions we work with (e.g. $\mathcal{N}$, $\chi^2$, $\Gamma$) all fall under the exponential family. We now discuss two of these functions in our exponential family PDF: 

- $$ T(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ (for some $$ d \in \mathbb{N} $$) is the *sufficient statistic*. In words, this means that $$ T(\mathbf{x}) $$ holds all information about parameter $\mathbf{\theta}$. In math, the conditional distribution $$\mathbf{x} \mid T(\mathbf{x}) $$ does not depend at all on $\mathbf{\theta}$.

- $$ \mathbf{\eta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ is the natural parameter. For our purposes, it is a convenient re-expression of $$\mathbf{\theta} $$ amenable to this form (meaning that we have some (ideally invertible) function $$\mathbf{\theta} \mapsto \mathbf{\eta} $$).

The remaining functions $$A(\mathbf{\eta}) \in \mathbb{R}$$ and $$h(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}$$ are not too important for our purposes other than to just make sure that $$ f(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta}) $$ is a valid PDF (the former can be thought of as a normalization constant). *There is a lot more to the exponential family. Feel free to read [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family) and these [advanced notes](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/other-readings/chapter8.pdf) I found for a much more thorough discussion.*

##### discriminant analysis for exponential family data distributions 

Having established all background requisite knowledge, we are ready to understand how we can generalize LDA to data with class-conditional distributions in the exponential family. With a slight abuse of terminology[^why], let us call this new procedure we are outlining as exponential family discriminant analysis (EFDA). 

[^why]: The reason for why this is technically misleading is that the terminology for LDA/QDA is based on how the log-odds function is related to $$X$$. As we will see, this can differ based on the type of distribution our data takes (regardless of it is in the exponential family.) 

We start with our assumptions. We assume we have two classes of data where data in class one and zero are distributed according to respective exponential family PDFs $$f_1(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta}_1)$$ and $$f_0(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta}_0)$$ such that: 

$$
\underset{k \in \{0, 1\}}{f_k(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{\eta}_k)} = h(\mathbf{x}) \exp[\mathbf{\eta}_k \cdot T(\mathbf{x}) - A(\mathbf{\eta}_k)]
$$

First note that PDFs $$f_1$$ and $$f_0$$ only differ by their true (natural) parameter values $$\mathbf{\eta}_1$$ and $$\mathbf{\eta}_0$$. To perform classification for EFDA, we aim to model $$ p(X) $$ in the same way we did for LDA (see \eqref{p-x}). Thus, we must estimate through MLE the parameters $$\alpha, \mathbf{\eta}_1, $$ and $$\mathbf{\eta}_0$$. We now derive these MLEs, starting with our log-likelihood function: 

$$ 
\mathcal{L}(\alpha, \mathbf{\eta}_0, \mathbf{\eta}_1) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \log f(X_i, Y_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 1\} \log[\mathbb{P}(X_i \mid Y_i = 1) \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1)] + \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 0\} \log[\mathbb{P}(X_i \mid Y_i = 0) \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 0)]
$$

$$ 
= \sum_{i = 1}^n \log[h(X_i)] + \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 1\}[\log(\alpha) + \mathbf{\eta}_1 \cdot T(X_i) - A(\mathbf{\eta}_1)] + \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 0\}[\log(1 - \alpha) + \mathbf{\eta}_0 \cdot T(X_i) - A(\mathbf{\eta}_0)]
$$

From the derivations below, you can see that the MLEs for $\mathbf{\eta}_1$ and $\mathbf{\eta}_0$ do not have a general closed-form solution. This is because the function $A(\mathbf{\eta})$ will differ among distributions in the exponential family. For example, $A(\mathbf{\eta}) = e^{\mathbf{\eta}}$ for the Poisson distribution but $A(\mathbf{\eta}) = \log(1 + e^{\mathbf{\eta}})$ for the Bernoulli distribution. As such, the best we can do is give a condition for these MLEs, which we present below (boxed): 

<!-- Derivation of the alpha MLE -->
<details>
<summary> Derivation of $\hat{\alpha}$ </summary>
$$
0 = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \alpha} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 1 \}}{\alpha} - \frac{\mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 0\}}{1 - \alpha} \implies (1 - \alpha) \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 1 \} = \alpha \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{1}\{Y_i= 0\} \implies \hat{\alpha} = \frac{N_1}{n}
$$
</details>

<details>
<summary> Derivation of $\hat{\mathbf{\eta}}_1$ and $\hat{\mathbf{\eta}}_0$ </summary>

$$
0 = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_1} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{1}\{Y_i = 1\} [T(X_i) - \frac{\partial A(\mathbf{\eta}_1)}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_1}] \implies \sum_{i: Y_i = 1}^n T(X_i) = N_1 \cdot \frac{\partial A(\mathbf{\eta}_1)}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_1}
$$

and by identical logic our MLE for $\mathbf{\eta}_0$ must satisfy: 

$$\sum_{i: Y_i = 0}^n T(X_i) = N_0 \cdot \frac{\partial A(\mathbf{\eta}_0)}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_0}$$
</details>

<br/>

$$
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\hat{\alpha} = \frac{N_1}{n}, \quad \sum_{i: Y_i = 1}^n T(X_i) = N_1 \cdot \frac{\partial A(\mathbf{\eta}_1)}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_1}, \quad \sum_{i: Y_i = 0}^n T(X_i) = N_0 \cdot \frac{\partial A(\mathbf{\eta}_0)}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}_0}}
\label{efda-mle}
\end{equation}
$$

We are now ready to test EFDA with a simulation. 

#### worked example: weibull distribution 

We now test EFDA in practice. For this example, let us assume that our data in each class is distributed according to the [Weibull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family), which does have an exponential family parametrization. We can express this distribution as $$\text{Weibull}(\lambda, k)$$, where parameters $$\lambda > 0$$ (scale) and $$k > 0$$ (shape). Moreover, the Weibull PDF can be given by $$f(x) = \frac{k}{\lambda} (\frac{x}{\lambda})^{k - 1} \exp(-(\frac{x}{\lambda})^k)$$ for $$x \geq 0$$. We now state our assumptions for our data in each class: 

$$
X \mid Y = 0 \sim \text{Weibull}(\lambda_1, k) \quad X \mid Y = 1 \sim \text{Weibull}(\lambda_0, k)
$$

Recall that our goal with EFDA is to be able to learn $$\lambda_1$$ and $$\lambda_0$$, as well as $$\alpha = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1]$$, so as to be able to model  classifier function $$p(X) = \mathbb{P}[Y = 1 \mid X]$$. For this simulation, we specify the following ground truth values: 


$$ 
k = 3 \quad \lambda_1 = 2 \quad \lambda_0 = 4 \quad \alpha = 0.7
$$

Note that $$\alpha = 0.7$$ means that there is an overall bias towards data belonging in class one. We provide the following plot below to understand the distributions of our different data: 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Image for this post." src="/assets/img/efda-post/weibull-data.png">
</div>

While the above plot can feel slightly overwhelming, I would recommend pausing to make sure each curve makes sense. From it, we can see that roughly something like $$ x = 2.5 $$ seems to be a good barrier between data in class one (left) and data in class zero (right). As a bit of foreshadowing, we'll also compute the log-odds ratio for our data: 

$$
\log \frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)} = \log \frac{\alpha f_1(x)}{(1 - \alpha) f_0(x)} = \log \frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} + \log \frac{\frac{k}{\lambda_1} (\frac{x}{\lambda_1})^{k - 1} \exp(-(\frac{x}{\lambda_1})^k)}{\frac{k}{\lambda_0} (\frac{x}{\lambda_0})^{k - 1} \exp(-(\frac{x}{\lambda_0})^k)} = \log \frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} + k\log \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_1} + x^k(\frac{1}{\lambda_0^k} - \frac{1}{\lambda_1^k})
$$

and so the log-odds ratio are *not* a linear function of $$X$$. We now proceed to actually use our derived EFDA procedure to model $$p(X)$$ (green curve) from our given dataset $$\mathcal{D} = \{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$$. As a first step, we give the exponential family parametrization of the Weibull PDF, for when $$ k $$ is known a priori: 

$$
\eta = -\frac{1}{\lambda^k}, \quad h(x) = x^{k - 1}, \quad T(x) = x^k, \quad A(\eta) = \log(-\frac{1}{\eta k}) = \log(\frac{1}{\eta}) + \log(-\frac{1}{k})
$$



For a verification that this does indeed work see below: 

<details>
<summary> Verification of Weibull Exponential Family Parametrization </summary>
$$
h(x) \exp[\eta \cdot T(x) - A(\eta)] = x^{k - 1} \exp[-\frac{x^k}{\lambda^k} + \log(\frac{k}{\lambda^k})] = x^{k - 1} \cdot \frac{k}{\lambda^k} \exp[-(\frac{x}{\lambda})^k] = \frac{k}{\lambda} (\frac{x}{\lambda})^{k - 1} \exp[-(\frac{x}{\lambda})^k]
$$

which is exactly the PDF of a Weibull distribution.
</details>

<br/>

Recall that we are assuming that the true natural parameters $$\eta_1$$ and $$\eta_0$$ are different across each class. Now applying the derived MLE conditions stated in \eqref{efda-mle} for this specific exponential family parametrization, we can find the MLEs of $$\eta_1$$ and $$\eta_0$$. We start by deriving the former: 

$$ 
\sum_{i: Y_i = 1}^n T(X_i) = N_1 \cdot \frac{\partial A(\eta_1)}{\partial \eta_1} \implies \sum_{i: Y_i = 1}^n X_i^k = N_1 \cdot (-\frac{1}{\eta_1}) \implies \hat{\eta}_1 =  -\frac{N_1}{\sum_{i: Y_i = 1}^n X_i^k }
$$

and so by identical logic we have: 

$$
\hat{\eta}_0 =  -\frac{N_0}{\sum_{i: Y_i = 0}^n X_i^k }
$$

Thus, we now have all the necessary ingredients to perform EFDA on our given dataset. We first start by giving the code to generate samples from our data: 

```python
CLASS_ONE_TRUE_LAMBDA = 2
CLASS_ZERO_TRUE_LAMBDA = 4
ALPHA_TRUE = 0.7
K_TRUE = 5 # common across both classes

def generate_data(n_samples): 
    X_class_one = weibull_min.rvs(c=K_TRUE, scale=CLASS_ONE_TRUE_LAMBDA, size=n_samples, random_state=42)
    X_class_zero = weibull_min.rvs(c=K_TRUE, scale=CLASS_ZERO_TRUE_LAMBDA, size=n_samples, random_state=42)
    y = (np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=n_samples) <= 0.7).astype(int) 
    X = y * X_class_one + (1 - y) * X_class_zero
    return X, y 
```

As a baseline, we'll want to compare EFDA's results to those of Logistic Regression. While we can't do a direct comparison of their parameters (as they are inherently different), we'll be interested in seeing how they model the log-odds differently. Specifically, across a number of different trials (each with different sampled datasets), we'll want to see how Logistic's Regression and EFDA's log-odds ratio varies as a function of $$ X $$. We provide this plot below, across 100 different trials each with sample size $$n = 10^4$$: 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Image for this post." src="/assets/img/efda-post/weibull-log-reg-vs-efda.png">
</div>

The major takeaway from this plot is that in cases where the true log-odds function is nonlinear (green curve), Logistic Regression will fail to model this nuance whereas a correctly-specified EFDA classifier will be able to. Furthermore, because Logistic Regression can only model the log-odds linearly, this means that for certain values of $$ x $$ (e.g. small $$ x $$), it will overconfidently predict one class, and for other values of $$ x $$ (e.g. large $$ x $$), it will underconfidently predict the other class.


#### further considerations 

While EFDA did work quite well for this example with the Weibull distribution, note that it is not always guaranteed to do so. For instance, depending on the required $$A(\mathbf{\eta})$$ function, the MLE conditions in \eqref{efda-mle} do not always lend themselves to a closed-form solution. As an example, the chi-squared exponential family parametrization necessitates $$A(\eta) = \log \Gamma(\eta + 1) + (\eta + 1)\log2$$. Such a parametrization has an unwieldly derivative w.r.t $$\eta$$ and likely will not have a closed-form solution for the MLE. Furthermore, EFDA, similar to LDA, suffers from the same strong assumption of a priori knowledge of the distribution of data in each class. Not to mention that this distribution must be the same among each class. As such, EFDA should be thought of as a bespoke solution with nice properties.
