<summary> Proof of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality For Expectations </summary>


*Note that we alternatively could prove this inequality by showing that the $$\langle X, Y \rangle = \mathbb{E}[XY]$$ is an inner product space and then cite the C-S inequality.* 

Suppose we have random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ where $$\mathbb{E}[X^2]$$ and $$\mathbb{E}[Y^2]$$ are finite. Pick any $$t \in \mathbb{R}$$. It is obvious that $$\mathbb{E}[(tX + Y)^2] \geq 0$$ and so we have: 

$$
\mathbb{E}[(tX + Y)^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2]t^2 + 2\mathbb{E}[XY]t + \mathbb{E}[Y^2] \geq 0 
$$

which is a quadratic in $$t$$. Note that because we are sure for any $$t \in \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{E}[(tX + Y)^2] \geq 0 \implies $$ the discriminant (i.e. $$b^2 - 4ac$$) of the above quadratic is $$\leq 0$$. Using this condition for our quadratic above we have:  

$$
4\mathbb{E}[XY]^2 - 4\mathbb{E}[X^2]\mathbb{E}[Y^2] \leq 0 \implies \boxed{\mathbb{E}[XY]^2 \leq \mathbb{E}[X^2]\mathbb{E}[Y^2]}

<summary> Proof of Triangle Inequality for Expectations </summary>

Suppose we have real-valued random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ where $$\mathbb{E}[X]$$ and $$\mathbb{E}[Y]$$ are finite (i.e. $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are integrable). Then for any values our r.v.s $$X$$ and $$Y$$ can take on we have $$\vert X + Y \vert \leq \vert X \vert + \vert Y \vert \implies \mathbb{E}[\vert X + Y \vert] \leq \mathbb{E}[\vert X \vert + \vert Y \vert ] = \mathbb{E}[\vert X \vert] + \mathbb{E}[\vert Y \vert]$$. 

This is not a terribly interesting inequality, so we'll derive another expectation inequality relating differences. First note that for any r.v. $$W$$ we have $$\vert \mathbb{E}[W] \vert \leq \mathbb{E}[\vert W \vert]$$ as: 

$$
\vert \mathbb{E}[W] \vert = \vert \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} w f_{W}(w) dw \vert \leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \vert w \vert f_{W}(w) dw = \mathbb{E}[\vert W \vert]
$$

An alternative explanation is that this is an example of Jensen's inequality as the absolute value function is convex. Now defining r.v. $$W = X - Y$$, we have: 

$$ 
\vert \mathbb{E}[X] - \mathbb{E}[Y] \vert = \vert \mathbb{E}[W] \vert \leq \mathbb{E}[\vert W \vert] = \mathbb{E}[\vert X - Y \vert]
$$

or $$\vert \mathbb{E}[X] - \mathbb{E}[Y] \vert \leq \mathbb{E}[\vert X - Y \vert]$$. 

I found this particularly useful when trying to understand convergence in expectation (e.x. [this limit on page 6](https://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/2019600/martingalenotes.pdf)).

<summary> Informal Proof of Optional Stopping Theorem for Martingales </summary>

*I apologize in advance for any minor technicalities that might occur in informally proving this important theorem with minimal-to-no measure theory.* We first present this theorem, known as Optional Stopping Theorem (OST) or alternatively Doob's Optional Sampling theorem. 

<blockquote class="prompt-info" markdown="1">
##### Optional Stopping Theorem

Suppose we have a discrete-time martingale $$M = (X_n)_{n \geq 0}$$ where $$\mathbb{E}[\vert X_n \vert] < \infty$$ and $$\mathbb{E}[X_{n + 1} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = X_n$$. Furthermore, suppose we have a "bounded" stopping time $$T \in \mathbb{Z}$$ (i.e. $$\exists \ N \in \mathbb{Z}$$ s.t. $$N \geq T$$ [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely)). Then, martingale $$M$$ *stopped* at $$T$$ is a martingale and we have: 

$$\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \mathbb{E}[X_0]$$

Note that this above property is non-trivial as $$T$$ is a random variable dependent on the observed values $$X_{0}, \dots, X_T$$.

</blockquote>

We first define the stopped process. Defining $$T \wedge n = \text{min}(\{T, n\})$$, we can define the stopped process of our martingale $$(X_n)_{n \geq 0}$$ as $$Y_n = X_{T \wedge n}$$. Note that because $$N < \infty$$ and $$\vert Y_n \vert \leq \underset{0 \leq k \leq N}{\max} \vert X_k \vert \implies $$ we can be very certain $$Y_n$$ is finite. With these definitions out of the way, we'll first prove that $$(Y_n)_{n \geq 0}$$ is a martingale (w.r.t observed events $$\{X_n, \dots, X_0\} \supseteq \{Y_n, \dots, Y_0\}$$ ) or equivalently that:  

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_{n + 1} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = Y_n
$$

First note that $$\mathbb{E}[Y_{n + 1} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = \mathbb{E}[X_{T \wedge (n + 1)} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0]$$. Note that we can break $$\mathbb{E}[X_{T \wedge (n + 1)} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0]$$ into two different cases: 

**(1) Case One.** If $$T \leq n$$.

In this case, first note that $$T \leq n \implies T < n + 1 \implies T \wedge (n + 1) = T$$ and so: 

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_{T \wedge (n + 1)} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = \mathbb{E}[X_{T} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0]
$$

Furthermore, $$T \leq n \implies X_{T} \in \{X_N, \dots, X_0\}$$ and so $$\mathbb{E}[X_{T} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = X_T$$ (for the same reason $$\mathbb{E}[X_2 \mid X_3, \dots, X_0] = X_2$$. The value is already observed.) 

**(2) Case Two.** If $$T > n$$. 

In this case, $$T \geq n + 1 \implies T \wedge (n + 1) = n+ 1$$ and so: 

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_{T \wedge (n + 1)} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = \mathbb{E}[X_{n + 1} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = X_n
$$

Putting these two cases together, we have that: 

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_{n + 1} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = \mathbb{E}[X_{T \wedge (n + 1)} \mid X_n, \dots, X_0] = X_T\mathbf{1}\{T \leq n\} + X_n\mathbf{1}\{T > n\} = X_{T \wedge n} = Y_n
$$

which concludes that $$(Y_n)_{n \geq 0}$$ is a martingale. A natural implication of this is that $$\forall \ n, \mathbb{E}[Y_n] = \mathbb{E}[Y_0] = \mathbb{E}[X_0]$$. But then $$\forall \ n \geq N \geq T, \mathbb{E}[X_T] = \mathbb{E}[Y_n] = \mathbb{E}[X_0] \implies \mathbb{E}[X_T] = \mathbb{E}[X_0]$$. 

This last property has some actually neat implications. Namely, stopping at a good time (i.e. $$T$$) does not change the expected outcome from when you first started. For example, if you're doing a symmetric random walk with $$\$1$$ in both directions, your expected outcome when stopping after hitting $$\$5$$ is still the same as when you started -- zero dollars. More profoundly, timing the martingale often has no (expected) benefit.

<summary> Expected # of visits to transient state in an Absorbing Markov Chain </summary>

Suppose we have an absorbing Markov Chain with $$t$$ transient states and $$r$$ absorbing states. Then we can order its states so its transition matrix $$P$$ can be given as a block matrix: 

$$
P = \begin{bmatrix} Q & R \\ \mathbf{0} & I_r \end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that we can call $$Q$$ the *transient-transient* matrix as it gives the probability of going from one transient state to another. We'll use $$Q$$ to understand the number of visits to a given transient state. Let's first define the problem a bit more clearly: given absorbing Markov Chain $$M = \{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}$$ with initial transient state $$X_0 = i$$, we are interested in the expectation of the number of visits $$V_{ij} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \mathbf{1}\{X_n = j\}$$ to transient state $$j$$. We now take the expectation of $$V_{ij}$$ under the assumption that $$X_0 = i$$ (denoted by $$\mathbb{E}_i$$): 

$$
\mathbb{E}_i[V_{ij}] = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \mathbb{E}_i[\mathbf{1}\{X_k = j\}] = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}_i[X_k = j]
$$

*A few technicalities: Moving $$\mathbb{E}_i[\cdot]$$ into the infinite summation is allowed because $$V_{ij} \geq 0$$ (i.e. [Tonelli's theorem, way above my paygrade](https://faculty.fiu.edu/~meziani/Lecture18.pdf)). Furthermore, $$M$$ is absorbing $$\implies V_{ij} < \infty \implies \mathbb{E}_i[V_{ij}] < \infty$$.* 

The $$\mathbb{P}_i[X_k = j]$$ quantity is essentially the probability that $$\mathbb{P}[X_k = j \mid X_0 = i]$$. Through a simple matrix multiplication argument it should be clear that $$(Q^k)_{ij} = \mathbb{P}[X_k = j \mid X_0 = i] \implies$$ the expected number of visits to transient state $$j$$ starting from transient state $$i$$ is given by $$\mathbb{E}_i[V_{ij}] = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} (Q^k)_{ij}$$. 

This is not a terribly useful result due to the infinite summation. Luckily $$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} Q^k$$ is a [Neumann series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series) as: 

- (1) We formally can consider $$Q$$ as an operator $$Q: \mathbb{R}^t \to \mathbb{R}^t$$ by $$v \mapsto Qv$$ 
- (2) $$Q$$ (as an operator) is linear, meaning $$Q(cv + w) = cQ(v) + Q(w)$$
- (3) $$Q$$ (as an operator) operates on a [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space) $$\mathbb{R}^t$$ (this vector space is normed as $$t < \infty$$)
- (4) $$Q$$ (as an operator) [is bounded as it is defined on a finite dimensional normed space](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2983050/every-linear-operator-tx-to-y-on-a-finite-dimensional-normed-space-is-bounde) $$\ \mathbb{R}^t$$ 

So by the Neumann series theorem, we have:  

$$
\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} Q^k = (I_t - Q)^{-1}
$$

where $$(I_t - Q)^{-1}$$ when considered as a matrix and not an operator is canonically called the *fundamental matrix*. So to summarize, the $$(i, j)$$th entry of this matrix $$(I_t - Q)^{-1}$$ will give you the expected number of visits to transient state $$j$$ starting from transient state $$i$$ in our absorbing markov chain $$M$$.

<summary> Proof of Perceptron Mistake Bound </summary>

<em>I am hardly the first to present this slightly unknown result, but I found it very elegant and interesting so I wanted to share it here. Specifically, its amazing how it is a bound on model performance that does NOT rely on the number of samples provided, albeit only for training and under some relatively strong assumptions. </em>

<blockquote class="prompt-info" markdown="1">
##### Perceptron Mistake Bound

Suppose that we have a binary classification dataset $$\mathcal{D} = (x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_N, y_N)$$ where two conditions are satisfied: **(1)** $$ \forall \ 1 \leq i \leq N, \Vert x_i \Vert_2 \leq R $$
and **(2)** $$\exists \ w^{\star}$$ s.t. $$\Vert w^{\star} \Vert_2 = 1$$ and $$\forall \ 1 \leq i \leq N, y_i(w^{\star} \cdot x_i) \geq \gamma$$.

Then using the standard <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/pmb.pdf"> (online) perceptron learning algorithm </a> (see Figure 1), the total number of mistakes made during training $$\leq \frac{R^2}{\gamma^2}$$. Note that this is *online* as this bound is referring to the number of mistakes made while training on each new example $$(x_i, y_i)$$ as they come in. 
</blockquote>

<em> Proof</em>. This proof works by cleverly bounding $$\Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert$$, where $$k$$ refers to the number of updates (i.e. mistakes) incurred hitherto by training on this dataset. Essentially $$w^{k}$$ gives the current weight after training on $$\mathcal{D}$$ and incurring $$k$$ mistakes; $$w^{k + 1}$$ would give the weight after encountering a *new* sample, making a mistake with $$w^{k}$$, and updating $$w^{k}$$. 

We first start with the lower bound. Note that here $$(x_i, y_i)$$ below refer to the specific sample on which weight $$w^k$$ was updated (not necessarily $$i = k$$!) -- the specific value of $$(x_i, y_i)$$ nor the index $$i$$ is not important.

$$
w^{k + 1} \cdot w^{\star} = (w^{k} + y_ix_i) w^{\star} = w^{k} \cdot w^{\star} + y_i(w^{\star} \cdot x_i) \geq w_k \cdot w^{*} + \gamma
$$

In the perceptron learning algorithm, we initialize $$w_0 = \vec{0}$$. Thus by induction  we have that $$w^{k + 1} \cdot w^{\star} \geq w_k \cdot w^{*} + \gamma \implies w^{k + 1} \cdot w^{\star} \geq k \gamma$$. And now applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have: 

$$
\Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert \times \Vert w^{\star} \Vert = \Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert \geq w^{k + 1} \cdot w^{\star} \geq k \gamma \implies \Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert \geq k\gamma
$$

We now proceed with an upper bound for $$\Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert$$, starting with the perceptron update again. Note again that index $$i$$ below is for a completely new sample on which the $$(k + 1)$$th mistake was made:

$$
\Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert^2 = \Vert w^{k} + y_ix_i \Vert^2 = \Vert w^k \Vert^2 + (y_i)^2 \Vert x_i\Vert^2 + 2y_i(w^k \cdot x_i)
$$

Because $$w_k$$ made a mistake on $$(x_i, y_i) \implies y_i(w^k \cdot x_i) < 0 \implies \Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert^2 \leq \Vert w^k \Vert^2 + (y_i)^2 \Vert x_i \Vert^2$$. But $$(y_i)^2 = 1$$ and $$\Vert x_i \Vert \leq R$$ and so we have: 

$$
\Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert^2 \leq \Vert w^k \Vert^2 + R^2 \implies \Vert w^{k + 1}\Vert^2 \leq kR^2 \implies \Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert \leq R\sqrt{k}
$$

through another induction argument. Putting these two bounds together we have: 

$$
k\gamma \leq \Vert w^{k + 1} \Vert \leq R\sqrt{k} \implies \sqrt{k} \leq \frac{R}{\gamma} \implies \boxed{k \leq \frac{R^2}{\gamma^2}}
$$

In other words, the number of mistakes made on $$\mathcal{D}$$ while training with the online perceptron learning algorithm is $$\leq \frac{R^2}{\gamma^2}$$. Proof here is taken from <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/606-607-f18/slides607/lecture4-pmb.pdf"> CMU's 10-607 slides</a> with slightly more commentary.

<summary> Asymptotic Normality of Sample Quantiles  </summary>

*This derivation does not use Brownian motions.* Suppose we have a fixed percentile $$p$$ and a r.v. $$X$$ with true CDF $$F$$. Then we can define the true $$p$$-th quantile as $$q_p$$ where $$F(q_p) = p$$. Given samples $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$, we can define the sample $$p$$-th quantile as $$\hat{q}_p$$ where empirical CDF $$F_{n}(\hat{q}_p) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{1} \{ X_i \leq \hat{q}_p \} = p$$. We aim to understand the asymptotic distribution of $$\sqrt{n}(\hat{q}_p - q_p)$$. Note however that $$F_n(q_p)$$ does not necessarily equal $$p = F_n(\hat{q}_p)$$, although they should be close. Intuitively then, we first begin with a Taylor Series expansion of $$F_n(\hat{q}_p)$$ around $$q_p$$: 

$$
p = F_n(\hat{q}_p) \approx F_n(q_p) + F'_n(q_p)[\hat{q}_p - q_p] = F_n(q_p) + f(q_p)[\hat{q}_p - q_p]
$$

$$
\implies p \approx F_n(q_p) + f(q_p)[\hat{q}_p - q_p] \implies \sqrt{n}[\hat{q}_p - q_p] \approx \frac{\sqrt{n}[p - F_n(q_p)]}{f(q_p)}
$$

We'll be interested in having some convergence in distribution argument for the numerator. To do we use, we use Donsker's Theorem, presented below without proof: 

<blockquote class="prompt-info" markdown="1">
##### Donsker's Theorem

Suppose we have IID samples $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$ with a corresponding empirical CDF $$F_n$$. Then for a fixed $$x$$ we have that: 

$$
\sqrt{n}[F_n(x) - F(x)] \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0, F(x)[1 - F(x)])
$$

</blockquote>

Applying Donsker's Theorem above with $$x = q_p$$, we arrive at the following: 

$$
\sqrt{n}[F_n(q_p) - p] \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0, p(1 - p))
$$

and so with Slutsky's Lemma we have: 

$$
\sqrt{n}[\hat{q}_p - q_p] \approx \frac{\sqrt{n}[p - F_n(q_p)]}{f(q_p)} \overset{d}{\to} \boxed{\mathcal{N}(0, \frac{p(1 - p)}{f(q_p)^2})}

<summary> Asymptotic Normality of M-Estimators </summary>

Suppose we have i.i.d samples $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$ and our goal is to estimate $$\theta$$. Brushing aside technicalities, let us define a differentiable function $$\rho: \mathcal{X} \times \Theta \to \mathbb{R}$$ where $$\psi(x, \theta) = \frac{\partial \rho(x, \theta)}{\partial \theta}$$. Then estimator $$\hat{\theta} = \underset{\theta}{\text{argmax}} \  \sum_{i = 1}^n \rho(X_i, \theta)$$ is an $$M$$-estimator. The true parameter value $$\hat{\theta}_0$$ we wish to estimate can be given as $$\theta_0 = \underset{\theta}{\text{argmax}} \ \mathbb{E}[\rho(X, \theta)]$$. Note that these expectations are over our samples, and we <em> do not </em> assume any knowledge of the distribution of $$X$$. By definition of the $$M$$-estimator, we have $$\sum_{i} \psi(X_i, \hat{\theta}) = 0$$ and so using a Taylor Series expansion:  

$$
\small
0 = \sum_{i} \psi(X_i, \hat{\theta}) \approx \sum_{i} \psi(X_i, \theta_0) + \sum_{i} \psi'(X_i, \theta_0)  \implies \sqrt{n}[\hat{\theta} - \theta_0] \approx \frac{\sqrt{n}  \sum_{i} \psi(X_i, \theta_0)}{ - \sum_{i} \psi'(X_i, \theta_0)} = \frac{ \sum_{i} \psi(X_i, \theta_0) / \sqrt{n}}{ - \sum_{i} \psi'(X_i, \theta_0) / n}
$$

This is nearly identical logic to <a href="/notes/s&ds-242/Sandwich_Variance.pdf"> this derivation</a> of the Sandwich Asymptotic Variance for MLEs in model misspecification scenarios. This is indeed because the MLE is a case of the general $$M$$-estimator. Using that derivation, we arrive at: 

$$
    \sqrt{n}[\hat{\theta} - \theta_0] \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0, V^{-1}WV^{-1}) 
$$

where $$V = \mathbb{E}[\psi'(X, \theta_0)]$$ and $$W = \mathbb{E}[\psi(X, \theta_0)^2]$$.

<summary> Derivation for Two-Sided Ockham's Razor Bound </summary>

<em> Notation follows from these <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/CourseNotes/StatisticalLearningTheoryNotes.pdf">lecture notes</a>.</em> <br/>

Let us define our finite (binary) function class as $$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, \dots, f_M \}$$ where each function in $$\mathcal{F}$$ predicts either $$-1$$ or $$1$$. Notation $$\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n$$ indicates that a probability is taken over the randomness of data draws $$Z_1, \dots, Z_n \sim D$$ where each $$Z_i = (X_i, Y_i)$$. Then $$\forall \epsilon > 0$$ we have: 

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[\exists \ f  \in \mathcal{F} : | R^{\text{true}}(f) - R^{\text{emp}}(f)| > \epsilon] \leq \sum_{j = 1}^M \mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[| R^{\text{true}}(f_j) - R^{\text{emp}}(f_j)| > \epsilon]
$$

Applying the two-sided Hoeffding's Inequality, we know that $$\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[\mid R^{\text{true}}(f_j) - R^{\text{emp}}(f_j) \mid > \epsilon] \leq 2\exp(-2n\epsilon^2)$$ and so: 

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[\exists \ f  \in \mathcal{F} : | R^{\text{true}}(f) - R^{\text{emp}}(f)| > \epsilon] \leq 2M\exp(-2n\epsilon^2)
$$

To express this more nicely, let us define $$\delta = 2M \exp(-2n\epsilon^2)$$ so we can express $$\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{\log M + \log \frac{2}{\delta}}{2n}}$$.

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[\exists \ f  \in \mathcal{F} : | R^{\text{true}}(f) - R^{\text{emp}}(f)| > \sqrt{\frac{\log M + \log \frac{2}{\delta}}{2n}}] \leq \delta
$$

$$
\implies \mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{Z} \sim D^n}[\forall \ f  \in \mathcal{F} : | R^{\text{true}}(f) - R^{\text{emp}}(f)| \leq \sqrt{\frac{\log M + \log \frac{2}{\delta}}{2n}}] \geq 1 - \delta
$$

which is exactly the two-sided Ockham's Razor Bound.

<summary> L2 Regularization: Gaussian Prior on Weights for Linear Regression </summary>

We first assume that $$y = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{w} + \epsilon$$ where $$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$. Second, we assume that weights $$ \mathbf{w} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \tau^2 \mathbf{I}) $$. Using our posterior distribution $$ \mathbf{w} \mid \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}$$, we can get an understanding of $$\mathbf{w}_{\text{MAP}}$$: 

$$ \ 
f(\mathbf{w} \mid \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}) \propto f(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{X}) f(\mathbf{w}) \implies \mathbf{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmax}} \ [f(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{X}) f(\mathbf{w})]
$$

$$
\implies \mathbf{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmax}} \ [\log f(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{X}) + \log f(\mathbf{w})] 
$$

Given that $$ y_i \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x_i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w}, \sigma^2)$$, we can give a nice understanding of $$ \log f(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{X}) $$: 

$$
\log f(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \log f(y_i \mid \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x_i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n - \log(\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2 = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i = 1}^n (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2 + \text{const}
$$

where the constant is w.r.t to $$\mathbf{w}$$. For the log-density of our prior $$\log f(\mathbf{w})$$ we have: 

$$
\log f(\mathbf{w}) = \log[\exp(-\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{w} - 0)^T (\tau^2 \mathbf{I})^{-1} (\mathbf{w} - 0) )] + \text{const} = -\frac{1}{2 \tau^2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}
$$

where $$\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}$$ is just the square of the L2 norm. Putting this together we have: 

$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmax}} \ [-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i = 1}^n (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2   -\frac{1}{2 \tau^2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}] = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmin}} \ [\sum_{i = 1}^n (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2   + \frac{\sigma^2}{\tau^2} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}]
$$

Thus, we can conclude that MAP for weights under a Gaussian prior follows the objective as L2/Ridge Regression (albeit with a tuned $$ \lambda $$ resembling the $$\frac{\sigma^2}{\tau^2}$$) terms.

<summary> L1 Regularization: Laplace Prior on Weights for Linear Regression </summary>

For our weights $$\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$, we assume each individual weight component is independent with prior $$w_i \sim \text{Laplace}(0, b)$$. So we get the following log-density for our weights: 

$$
\log f(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i = 1}^d f(w_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^d \frac{-|w_i - 0 |}{b} + \text{const.} = -\frac{1}{b} \sum_{i = 1}^d |w_i| + \text{const.}
$$

and so using identical work from the previous L2 derivation we get: 


$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmax}} \ [-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i = 1}^n (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2  + \log f(\mathbf{w})] = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\text{argmin}} \ [\sum_{i = 1}^n (\mathbf{y_i} - \mathbf{x_i}^T \mathbf{w})^2   + \frac{2\sigma^2}{b} \sum_{i = 1}^d |w_i|]
$$

Thus, we arrive at a similar conclusion that MAP for weights under a Laplace prior follows the same objective as L1 Regularization (where hyperparameter $$\lambda$$ is tuned to resemble the $$\frac{2\sigma^2}{b}$$ term.)

<summary> Ridge Regression Closed Form Solution </summary>

While the closed-form Normal Equation solution & <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/derivation-of-the-normal-equation-for-linear-regression/"> derivation</a> is well-known, the closed-form solution for ridge regression is less so. Taken straight from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression"> Wikipedia page</a>, we provide our cost function below for data $$\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$$, weights $$\mathbf{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^p$$, and labels $$\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$:

$$
J(\mathbf{\beta}) = (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X\beta})^T (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X\beta}) + \lambda(\mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{\beta} - c) = (\mathbf{y}^T - \mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{X}^T)(\mathbf{y - X\beta}) + \lambda(\mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{\beta} - c)
$$

$$
= \mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X\beta} - \beta^T\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X\beta} + \lambda(\mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{\beta} - c)
$$

Note that $$\mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X\beta}$$ and $$\beta^T\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}$$ are both scalars and are transposes of each other. Thus, they are equal and so we can write: 

$$
J(\mathbf{\beta}) = \mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{y} - 2\beta^T\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X\beta} + \lambda(\mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{\beta} - c) 
$$

We can think of this as essentially a Lagrange multiplier optimization problem, where our constraint is that $$\mathbf{\beta}^T\mathbf{\beta} - c = 0$$ for some $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$. We'll see that this choice of $$c$$ does not matter too much; it only matters that the constraint is there. We proceed: 

$$
0 = \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{\beta})}{\partial \mathbf{\beta}} = -2\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} + 2\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X\beta} + \lambda(2\mathbf{\beta}) \implies \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X + \lambda I})\mathbf{\beta} 
$$

and so we get the final closed-form solution: 

$$
\mathbf{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X + \lambda I})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

## just for fun

Across the spring term this year, I visited some friends at Berkeley and UC Davis multiple times! During my stay, I had the privilege of attending a good amount of classes. I took some notes[^note] for my fun and memories:
