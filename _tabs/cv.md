hey there! I'm an undergraduate at Yale University double majoring in computer science and
mathematics. I am currently focused on using statistics to understand machine-learning models. Over the past few years, some research areas I
have explored include [out-of-distribution (OOD) detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10176), [multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12999), and
[basic neural network optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00186). I have had the privilege of presenting research at CVPR 2024, NeurIPS 2023, AAAI 2023, and Databricks Data+AI Summit 2022. To date, I have [50 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=UKAB_04AAAAJ).

Additionally, I love building software to reach thousands. I have written a few notable Chrome Extensions, specifically one for [accessibility](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/genalt-generate-ai-altern/ekbmkapnmnhhgfmjdnchgmcfggibebnn?pli=1) and another for [Yale](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yale-hospitality-wrapped/idodopjdnfehepljegmmmkgbelpogple)/[USC](https://dailytrojan.com/2025/02/20/students-launch-usc-hospitality-wrapped/). I also have experience [leading](/notes/lhsjobshadow.pdf) and [contributing](https://alphaxiv.org) to much larger full-stack platforms. If you have an idea, please [reach out](mailto:anish.lakkapragada@yale.edu).

In my free time, I enjoy reading and [photographing birds](https://unsplash.com/@anishlk).
